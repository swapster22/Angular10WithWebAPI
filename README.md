# Angular10WithWebAPI
The Project is about Employee Data Management Portal where one can view the list of employees in the organization, add an employee data to the existing list, update an employee data and also delete an employee data. 
Basically, performing CRUD Operations using Angular 10 and Web API. For Database, using MySql. 
In angular 10, I installed primeng, primeicons, primeflex and bootstrap packages for UI Enhancement
For Backened process, I created WebAPI using .NET 5 Core.
